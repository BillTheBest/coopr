## [Cask](http://cask.co) Coopr: Modern Cluster Management

Cask Coopr is cluster management software that manages clusters on public, private
clouds. Clusters created with Cask Coopr utilize templates of any hardware and
software stack, from simple standalone LAMP-stack servers and traditional application
servers like JBoss, to full Apache Hadoop clusters comprised of thousands of nodes.
Clusters can be deployed across many cloud providers (Rackspace, Joyent, and OpenStack)
while utilizing common SCM tools (Chef and scripts).

   single: Coopr Upgrade

==================
Coopr Upgrade
==================

.. highlight:: console

This is an overview of the upgrade path from Coopr 0.9.8 to Coopr 0.9.9.

Upgrade Steps
-------------
We are assuming you have access to all (current 0.9.8) Coopr servers and are logged in to those.

1. Stop all processes

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/coopr-provisioner stop
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/coopr-ui stop
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/coopr-server stop

2. Back up your database

  * It is recommended to backup your database. Consult your database vendor's documentation for instructions.

3. Upgrade Database Schema (if using an external database)

  * You have to update the schema for any external database. However, we only provide example SQL files for MySQL. The changes need to be made to any external database. Here is how you would do with MySQL:

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ mysql -p coopr < /opt/coopr/server/sql/upgrade-tables-pre0.9.9-to-0.9.9.sql

4. Change provisioner.server.uri port

  * Edit the ``provisioner.server.uri`` property in ``/etc/coopr/conf/provisioner-site.xml`` and change the port from 55054 to 55055. Here is an example (changing your server to the correct host/FQDN):
  .. parsed-literal::
   <property>
     <name>provisioner.server.uri</name>
     <value>http://myserver.mydomain.com:55055</value>
     <description>URI of server to connect to</description>
   </property> 

5. Run the upgrade script

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ /etc/init.d/coopr-server upgrade

6. Start Coopr Server, UI and Provisioner services

  .. parsed-literal::
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/coopr-server start
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/coopr-ui start
   $ sudo /etc/init.d/coopr-provisioner start
